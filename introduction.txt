Brief Introduction About Myself


My name is Daniel Igwe. I am 22 years old, and I've been out of college for about a year.
Im currently trying to go back and finish my degree, while working for my Uncle's company to build experience.
I specialize in backend engineering, databases, and building solutions to real-world problems. I want to be rich in the future.
